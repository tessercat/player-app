<p>
Eternal because every ending is a new beginning,
infinite because everything circles back to where it started,
perfect because it moves indivisibly as one.
</p>

<p>
We're all conjured from it but not separate from it.
It gives birth to us, raises us,
gives birth but doesn't play favourites,
influences but doesn't interfere,
parents but doesn't punish,
gets it done but doesn't get credit.
</p>

<p>
It's a lot like water.
Water helps everyone
and people don't get mad at it,
even when it does something people don't like.
It's consistent,
open,
friendly,
honest,
fair,
useful
and adaptable,
and above all,
people don't get mad at it
because it's not trying to do good.
</p>

<p>
Be like water.
